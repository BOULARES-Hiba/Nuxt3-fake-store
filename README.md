This project is a demonstration of a product display application built using Nuxt 3. It fetches product data from the Fake Store API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The application includes features such as dynamic routing for product details, a responsive grid layout for product listing, and a visual feedback mechanism when adding products to the cart.
